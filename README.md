## Code-Snippet 💻

JavaScript

Function to set timeblock to different color using Moment.js

Use ".isBefore" ".isSame" and ".isAfter" to compare the timeblock row time to current time.

```JavaScript
for (var i = 0; i < hour.length; i++ ) {

    var hourBlock = hourStart.add(1,"h")
    
    if (hourBlock.isBefore(hourNow)) {
        //add css class to the timeblock row respectively
            $(eventColumn[i]).addClass("past")
    } 
    else if (hourBlock.isSame(hourNow)) {
            $(eventColumn[i]).addClass("present")
    }      
         else { 
            $(eventColumn[i]).addClass("future")
    }
}
```


Function to add row in the container section and append with buttons, textarea and hours.

This function is built with a for lop and avoids hard coding in html.

```JavaScript
for (var i = 0; i < hourLength; i++ ){
    var eventColumn = $("<div>");
    eventColumn.addClass("row  time-block");
        
    var hour = $("<div>")
    hour.addClass("hour col-1");
    hour.text((i+hourLength) + ":00")

    var userMessage = $("<textarea>");
    userMessage.addClass("textarea col-9 description");

    var saveBtn = $("<button>");
    saveBtn.addClass("saveBtn col-1");

    var iconSave =$("<i>");
    iconSave.addClass("far fa-save");

    var deleteBtn = $("<button>");
    deleteBtn.addClass("deleteBtn col-1");
        
    var iconDelete = $("<i>");
    iconDelete.addClass("fas fa-trash-alt");


    saveBtn.append(iconSave);
    deleteBtn.append(iconDelete)
    eventColumn.append(hour);
    eventColumn.append(userMessage);
    eventColumn.append(saveBtn);
    eventColumn.append(deleteBtn)
    $(".container").append(eventColumn);
}
```
